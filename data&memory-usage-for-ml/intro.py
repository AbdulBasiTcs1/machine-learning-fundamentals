# Understanding Data and Memory usage for Machine Learning

# Objective: 
# This lab will give you practical implementation of different types of sequences including lists, 
# tuples, sets and dictionaries. We will use lists alongside loops in order to know about indexing 
# individual items of these containers. This lab will also allow students to write their own functions. 

# Activity Outcomes: 
# ability to: 
# Develop a basic understanding of data structures commonly used for AI 
# Understanding Lists and Tupples 
# Solving complex mathematical problems 
# Using loops with lists 
# Developing customized functions for logical inference 
# Basic understanding of Object Oriented Concepts like Class definitions etc.
