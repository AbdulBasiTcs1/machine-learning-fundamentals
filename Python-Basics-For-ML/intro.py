# Python Basics for Machine Learning 

# Objective: 
# This lab is an introductory session on Python. It is a powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to 
# Perl, Ruby, Scheme and Java. This lab will enable the students to learn the core building blocks used in AI based 
# approaches. 

# Activity Outcomes: 
# The expected outcome of this lab activi 
# Basic use of conditionals 
# Basic use of loops 
# Basic use of math libraries 
# Developing a basic logic inference engine 

# 1) Useful Concepts 
# Programming is simply the act of entering instructions for the computer to perform. These instructions might 
# crunch some numbers, modify text, look up information in files, or communicate with other computers over 
# the Internet. All programs use basic instructions as building blocks. 
# You can combine these building blocks to implement more intricate decisions, too. Programming is a 
# creative task, somewhat like constructing a castle out of LEGO bricks. You start with a basic idea of what 
# you want your castle to look like 
# finished building your program, you can pretty up your code just like you would your castle. 
# Python refers to the Python programming language (with syntax rules for writing what is considered valid 
# Python code) and the Python interpreter software that reads source code (written in the Python language) 
# and performs its instructions. The name Python comes from the surreal British comedy group Monty Python, 
# not from the snake. Python programmers are affectionately called Pythonistas. 
# the language rather than building professional software, then you should install from the Microsoft Store 
# package. This offers the shortest and easiest path to getting started with minimal hassle. 
# Windows environment, then the official Python.org 
# limited by Microsoft Store policies, and you can control where the executable is installed and even add 
# Python to PATH if necessary. 
# In Python,a namespace is a collection of names and the details of the objects referenced by the names. We 
# can consider a namespace as a python dictionary which maps object names to objects. The keys of the 
# dictionary correspond to the names and the values correspond to the objects in python. In python, there are 
# four types of namespaces, namely built-in namespaces,global namespaces, local namespaces and enclosing 
# namespaces.
