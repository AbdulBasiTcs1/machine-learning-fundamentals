# # Useful Concepts
 
# The two basic types of regression are simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, although there 
# are non-linear regression methods for more complicated data and analysis. Simple linear regression uses 
# one independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of the dependent variable Y, while multiple 
# linear regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome. 
 
# Regression can help finance and investment professionals as well as professionals in other businesses. 
# Regression can also help predict sales for a company based on weather, previous sales, GDP growth, or 
# other types of conditions. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an often-used regression model in 
# finance for pricing assets and discovering costs of capital. 
 
# The general form of each type of regression is: 
 
# Simple linear regression: Y = a + bX + u 
# Multiple linear regression: Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3 + ... + btXt + u 
# Where: 
# Y = the variable that you are trying to predict (dependent variable). 
# X = the variable that you are using to predict Y (independent variable). 
# a = the intercept. 
# b = the slope. 
# u = the regression residual. 
# There are two basic types of regression: simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. 
# Regression takes a group of random variables, thought to be predicting Y, and tries to find a mathematical 
# relationship between them. This relationship is typically in the form of a straight line (linear regression) 
# that best approximates all the individual data points. In multiple regression, the separate variables are 
# differentiated by using subscripts. 
# KEY TAKEAWAYS 
# Regression helps investment and financial managers to value assets and understand the relationships 
# between variables
